Xiaocheng Ai,Corner Canyon High School,"Xiaocheng, known as Emily, is a junior committed to pursuing a career in computer science and machine learning. She has undertaken several personal projects, focusing on both web and mobile app development. Among her achievements, she is particularly proud of SumNation, an app she developed independently using Flutter and Dart. This app excels at summarizing text of varying lengths while preserving essential ideas and details. Emily's technical proficiency spans multiple programming languages, including Java, Python, and C#, and she is well-versed in software development frameworks like React and Flutter. This diverse skill set allows her to execute her innovative ideas with finesse and precision. Having recently secured a software development internship at a local company, Emily looks forward to gaining further practical experience this upcoming summer. Her dedication to her craft and relentless pursuit of excellence have reaffirmed her decision to pursue a computer science major. Emily is also very interested in machine learning and driven by a desire to engage with cutting-edge technology. She envisions herself as a future leader in the field, committed to pushing the boundaries of innovation and leveraging artificial intelligence to shape the future.",Xiaocheng-Ai.jpg
Amber Cruz,Jordan Academy for Technology and Careers,"Amber is a high school senior pursuing a future in robotics engineering and computer science. She is an active member of the Technology Student Association and earned a state-level placement in System Control at last year's Technology Association competition in Utah. Amber's journey into robotics began in middle school, where she took her first real robotics class. Before that, she had always thought of robots as something for the distant future, with her early aspirations leaning toward becoming a comic artist. However, that hands-on class opened her eyes to the world of robotics, where her interest in the human body's mechanisms and digital literacy converged in a way she still finds beautiful. The robotics and electronics classes she took during her junior year, along with supportive teachers, helped her feel engaged and safe in the classroom. Amber grew significantly that year, nurtured by a field she is deeply passionate about. She continues her studies at JATC, determined to achieve her goal of becoming a Doctor of Robotics.",Amber-Cruz.jpg
Ariana Soto,Northern Utah Academy for Mathematics Engineering and Science, "Ariana's passion for building and STEM began at a young age, watching her dad work on various projects around the house. Ariana's academic progress has been remarkable. In her junior year, she took Calculus 3 and Physics 2210 (Physics for Scientists and Engineers 1).  She has completed CS courses up to CS 2430 and will graduate with a Programming Essentials certificate from Weber State University. Additionally, she will earn associates degrees in General Education, Pre-Engineering, and Math by the time she graduates from high school. Last summer, she attended Girls State, where she was elected as a State Delegate, City Treasurer, and State Chairwoman. During her junior year, she worked with Hill Air Force Base's Software Engineering Group. She was later selected for the Northrop Grumman HIP internship program, where she performed so well that she was invited to continue working with them during her senior year. In her free time, Ariana enjoys musical theater, singing, playing the piano, soccer, basketball, and participating in debate. Despite her busy schedule, Ariana has found time to give back to her community by working with animals at Petco, tutoring students at Mountain View Elementary, and cleaning the grounds at the Ogden Nature Center.",Ariana-Soto.jpg
